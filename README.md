# Airplane Search and Sort Lab 🛫 👀 

Welcome to the "Airplane Search and Sort" lab! 🛫✈️ This Java program explores linear and binary search algorithms, as well as bubble sort, to manage and analyze information about different airplanes. The program provides functionality to search for airplanes based on duration and capacity, and also demonstrates sorting the airplanes array.

## How to Use 🛠️ 

1. **Linear Search on Duration:**
   - Execute the `linearSearchByDuration` method by providing a duration value when prompted. The program will display information if an airplane with the specified duration is found.

2. **Linear Search on Capacity:**
   - Execute the `linearSearchByCapacity` method by providing a capacity value when prompted. The program will display information if an airplane with the specified capacity is found.

3. **Bubble Sort and Display:**
   - Execute the `bubbleSortByDuration` and `bubbleSortByCapacity` methods to sort the array based on duration and capacity, respectively. The sorted array will be printed.

4. **Binary Search on Duration:**
   - Execute the `binarySearchDuration` method by providing a duration value when prompted. The program will display information if an airplane with the specified duration is found.

5. **Binary Search on Capacity:**
   - Execute the `binarySearchByCapacity` method by providing a capacity value when prompted. The program will display information if an airplane with the specified capacity is found.

## Airplane Class 🛩️ 

The `Airplane` class represents individual airplanes and includes methods to get information about their duration, capacity, and other attributes.
